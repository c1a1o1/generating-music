# Attachment

The whole attachment is divided into four different folders that are briefly described below. More details can be found in readme files contained in each of them.


## Analyzer

GUI application used for analysis, conversion and visualization of .mid and internal .mus files. Please note that the GUI front-end is a side project, not an explicit part of the bachelor thesis, but it contains all algorithms described in Chapter 5 about music analysis. We use it for an easier and more intuitive evaluation of the algorithms.


## Generative Model

Source files for the generative model implemented in PyTorch (deep learning library for python). It also contains already trained models that can be used to generate new music.


## Samples

Sample files outputed from the models contained in the Generative Model folder. The folder contains both good and bad sounding examples that should illustrate the overall behaviour of the generative model.


## Survey

Files related to the online questionaire. Contains the 104 audio files used in the questionaire and also a table with all answers from 293 users.
